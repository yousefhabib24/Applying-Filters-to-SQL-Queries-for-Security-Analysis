# 🔍 Applying Filters to SQL Queries for Security Analysis

**Date:** November 2025

### Project Overview

This project involved using **SQL** to identify and analyze potential security incidents through data filtering. I applied logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) and pattern-matching tools (`LIKE`, `%`) to retrieve targeted information from organizational databases.

The queries were used to review after-hours failed login attempts, investigate suspicious logins by date and location, and isolate employee groups for system security updates. This project strengthened my ability to extract **actionable insights** from structured data to support cybersecurity and system administration objectives.
